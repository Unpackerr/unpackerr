# Unpackerr Example Configuration File
# The following values are application defaults.

# [true/false] Turn on debug messages in the output. Do not wrap this in quotes.
# Recommend trying this so you know what it looks like. I personally leave it on.
debug = false

# Disable writing messages to stdout. This silences the app. You should set a log
# file below if you set this to true.
quiet = false

# Write message to a log file. This is the same data that is normally output to stdout.
# This setting is great for Docker users that want to export their logs to a file.
# The alternative is to use syslog to log the output of the application to a file.
# Default is no log file, so this is unset.

# How often to poll sonarr and radarr.
# Recommend 1m-5m. Uses Go Duration.
interval = "2m"

# How long to wait for a reply from the backends: Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr.
# This can also be set per-app. Uses Go Duration.
timeout = "10s"

# How long ago a file must have been imported before deletion. The file must
# also not be part of an active queue item. Set this to "1m" to make sure files
# are deleted quickly after being imported. Recommend "5m". Uses Go Duration.

# How long an item must be queued (download complete) before extraction will start.
# One minute is the historic default and works well. Set higher if your downloads
# take longer to finalize (or transfer locally). Uses Go Duration.

# How long to wait before removing the history for a failed extraction.
# Once the history is deleted the item will be recognized as new and
# extraction will start again. Uses Go Duration.

# How many files may be extracted in parallel. 1 works fine.
# Do not wrap the number in quotes. Raise this only if you have fast disks and CPU.

# Use these configurations to control the file modes used for newly extracted

## This application can also watch folders for things to extract. If you copy a
## subfolder into a watched folder (defined below) any extractable items in the
## folder will be decompressed. This has *nothing* to do with Sonarr/Lidarr/Radarr.
