##      Unpackerr Example Configuration File      ##
## The following values are application defaults. ##
## Environment Variables may override all values. ##
## More configuration help: https://unpackerr.zip ##
####################################################

## [true/false] Turn on debug messages in the output. Do not wrap this in quotes.
## Recommend trying this so you know what it looks like. I personally leave it on.
debug = false

## Disable writing messages to stdout/stderr. This silences the app. Set a log
## file below if you set this to true. Recommended when starting with systemctl.
quiet = false

## Send error output to stderr instead of stdout by setting error_stderr to true.
## Recommend leaving this at false. Ignored if quiet (above) is true.
error_stderr = false

## Setting activity to true will silence all app queue log lines with only zeros.
## Set this to true when you want less log spam.
activity = false

## The Starr-application activity queue is logged on an interval.
## Adjust that interval with this setting.
## Default is a minute. 2m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h are also perfectly acceptable.
log_queues = "1m"

## Write messages to a log file. This is the same data that is normally output to stdout.
## This setting is great for Docker users that want to export their logs to a file.
## The alternative is to use syslog to log the output of the application to a file.
## Default is no log file; this is unset. log_files=0 turns off auto-rotation.
## Default files is 10 and size(mb) is 10 Megabytes; both doubled if debug is true.
#log_file = '/downloads/unpackerr.log'
log_files = 10
log_file_mb = 10

## How often to poll sonarr and radarr.
## Recommend 1m-5m. Uses Go Duration.
interval = "2m"

## How long an item must be queued (download complete) before extraction will start.
## One minute is the historic default and works well. Set higher if your downloads
## take longer to finalize (or transfer locally). Uses Go Duration.
start_delay = "1m"

## How long to wait before removing the history for a failed extraction.
## Once the history is deleted the item will be recognized as new and
## extraction will start again. Uses Go Duration.
retry_delay = "5m"

## How many files may be extracted in parallel. 1 works fine.
## Do not wrap the number in quotes. Raise this only if you have fast disks and CPU.
parallel = 1

## Use these configurations to control the file modes used for newly extracted
## files and folders. Recommend 0644/0755 or 0666/0777.
file_mode = "0644"
dir_mode = "0755"

[webserver]
## The web server currently only supports metrics; set this to true if you wish to use it.
  metrics = false
## This may be set to a port or an ip:port to bind a specific IP. 0.0.0.0 binds ALL IPs.
  listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:5656"
## Recommend setting a log file for HTTP requests. Otherwise, they go with other logs.
  log_file = ""
## This app automatically rotates logs. Set these to the size and number to keep.
  log_files = 10
  log_file_mb = 10
## Set both of these to valid file paths to enable HTTPS/TLS.
  ssl_cert_file = ""
  ssl_key_file = ""
## Base URL from which to serve content.
  urlbase = "/"
## Upstreams should be set to the IP or CIDR of your trusted upstream proxy.
## Setting this correctly allows X-Forwarded-For to be used in logs.
## In the future it may control auth proxy trust. Must be a list of strings.
  upstreams = [ ] # example: upstreams = [ "127.0.0.1/32", "10.1.2.0/24" ]
