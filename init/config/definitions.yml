      ##       Unpackerr Example Configuration File        ##
      #######################################################
      ##  The values are a mix of defaults and examples.   ##
      ##  Environment Variables may override all values.   ##
      ##  More configuration help: https://unpackerr.zip   ##
      ## Config Generator: https://notifiarr.com/unpackerr ##
      #######################################################
    docs: |
      These values must exist at the top of the config file.
      If you put them anywhere else they may be attached to a `[header]` inadvertently.
      When using environment variables, you can simply omit the ones you don't set or change from default.
    params:
    - name: debug
      envvar: DEBUG
      default: false
      recommend: *BOOLEAN
      short: Turns on more logs.
      desc: |
        Turn on debug messages in the output. Do not wrap this in quotes.
        Recommend trying this so you know what it looks like. I personally leave it on.
    - name: quiet
      envvar: QUIET
      default: false
      recommend: *BOOLEAN
      short: Do not print logs to stdout or stderr.
      desc: |
        Disable writing messages to stdout/stderr. This silences the app. Set a log
        file below if you set this to true. Recommended when starting with systemctl.
    - name: error_stderr
      envvar: ERROR_STDERR
      default: false
      recommend: *BOOLEAN
      short: Print ERROR lines to stderr instead of stdout.
      desc: |
        Send error output to stderr instead of stdout by setting error_stderr to true.
        Recommend leaving this at false. Ignored if quiet (above) is true.
    - name: activity
      envvar: ACTIVITY
      default: false
      recommend: *BOOLEAN
      short: Setting true will print only queue counts with activity.
      desc: |
        Setting activity to true will silence all app queue log lines with only zeros.
        Set this to true when you want less log spam.
    - name: log_queues
      envvar: LOG_QUEUES
      default: "1m"
      short: How often to print internal counters. Uses Go Duration.
      recommend: *QUEUE_INTERVALS
      desc: |
        The Starr-application activity queue is logged on an interval.
        Adjust that interval with this setting.
        Default is a minute. 2m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h are also perfectly acceptable.
    - name: log_file
      envvar: LOG_FILE
      default: ''
      example: /downloads/unpackerr.log
      short: Provide optional file path to write logs
      desc: |
        Write messages to a log file. This is the same data that is normally output to stdout.
        This setting is great for Docker users that want to export their logs to a file.
        The alternative is to use syslog to log the output of the application to a file.
        Default is no log file; this is unset.
        Except on macOS and Windows, the log file gets set to "~/.unpackerr/unpackerr.log"
        log_files=0 turns off auto-rotation.
        Default files is 10 and size(mb) is 10 Megabytes.
    - name: log_files
      envvar: LOG_FILES
      default: 10
      recommend: &NUMBERS
      - value: 1
      - value: 2
      - value: 3
      - value: 5
      - value: 10
      - value: 15
      - value: 20
      short: Log files to keep after rotating. `0` disables rotation
    - name: log_file_mb
      envvar: LOG_FILE_MB
      default: 10
      recommend: *NUMBERS
      short: Max size of log files in megabytes
    - name: log_file_mode
      envvar: LOG_FILE_MODE
      default: '0600'
      recommend: &FILE_MODES
      - value: '0600'
      - value: '0640'
      - value: '0660'
      - value: '0644'
      - value: '0664'
      short: "POSIX mode used for new log files; not for Windows"
    - name: interval
      envvar: INTERVAL
      default: 2m
      recommend: *GLOBAL_INTERVALS
      short: How often apps are polled, recommend `1m` to `5m`.
      desc: |
        How often to poll starr apps (sonarr, radarr, etc).
        Recommend 1m-5m. Uses Go Duration.
    - name: progress
      envvar: PROGRESS
      default: 15s
      recommend:
      - name: '2 seconds'
        value: '2s'
      - name: '5 seconds'
        value: '5s'
      - name: '10 seconds'
        value: '10s'
      - name: '15 seconds'
        value: '15s'
      - name: '1 minute'
        value: '1m'
      short: How often status is logged for in-progress extractions.
      desc: |
        How often status is logged for in-progress extractions.
        Recommend 2-60s. Uses Go Duration.
    - name: start_delay
      envvar: START_DELAY
      default: 1m
      recommend: *GLOBAL_INTERVALS
      short: Files are queued at least this long before extraction.
      desc: |
        How long an item must be queued (download complete) before extraction will start.
        One minute is the historic default and works well. Set higher if your downloads
        take longer to finalize (or transfer locally). Uses Go Duration.
    - name: retry_delay
      envvar: RETRY_DELAY
      default: 5m
      recommend: *GLOBAL_INTERVALS
      short: Failed extractions are retried after at least this long.
      desc: |
        How long to wait before removing the history for a failed extraction.
        Once the history is deleted the item will be recognized as new and
        extraction will start again. Uses Go Duration.
    - name: max_retries
      envvar: MAX_RETRIES
      default: 3
      recommend: *NUMBERS
      short: Failed extractions are retried after at least this long.
      desc: |
        How many times to retry a failed extraction. Pauses retry_delay between attempts.
    - name: parallel
      envvar: PARALLEL
      default: 1
      recommend: *NUMBERS
      short: Concurrent extractions, only recommend `1`
      desc: |
        How many files may be extracted in parallel. 1 works fine.
        Do not wrap the number in quotes. Raise this only if you have fast disks and CPU.
    - name: file_mode
      envvar: FILE_MODE
      default: '0644'
      recommend: *FILE_MODES
      short: Extracted files are written with this mode.
      desc: |
        Use these configurations to control the file modes used for newly extracted
        files and folders. Recommend 0644/0755 or 0666/0777.
    - name: dir_mode
      envvar: DIR_MODE
      default: '0755'
      recommend:
      - value: '0700'
      - value: '0750'
      - value: '0755'
      - value: '0770'
      - value: '0775'
      short: Extracted folders are written with this mode

  webserver:
    title: Web Server
    docs: |
      :::note Metrics
      The web server currently only provides prometheus metrics, which you can display in
      [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18817-unpackerr/).
      It provides no UI. This may change in the future. The web server was added in v0.12.0.
      :::
    envvar_prefix: WEBSERVER_
    params:
    - name: metrics
      envvar: METRICS
      default: false
      recommend: *BOOLEAN
      short: Extracted folders are written with this mode
      desc: The web server currently only supports metrics; set this to true if you wish to use it.
    - name: listen_addr
      envvar: LISTEN_ADDR
      default: 0.0.0.0:5656
      short:  ip:port to listen on; `0.0.0.0` is all IPs.
      desc: This may be set to a port or an ip:port to bind a specific IP. 0.0.0.0 binds ALL IPs.
    - name: log_file
      envvar: LOG_FILE
      default: ''
      short: Provide optional file path to write HTTP logs.
      desc: Recommend setting a log file for HTTP requests. Otherwise, they go with other logs.
    - name: log_files

      default: 10
      recommend: *NUMBERS
      short: Log files to keep after rotating. `0` to disable.

    - name: upstreams
      envvar: UPSTREAMS
      default: []
      kind: conlist
      short: List of upstream proxy CIDRs or IPs to trust.
      desc: |
        Upstreams should be set to the IP or CIDR of your trusted upstream proxy.
        Setting this correctly allows X-Forwarded-For to be used in logs.
        In the future it may control auth proxy trust. Must be a list of strings.
        example: upstreams = [ "127.0.0.1/32", "10.1.2.0/24" ]

      ################
      ### Webhooks ###
      ################
      # Sends a webhook when an extraction queues, starts, finishes, and/or is deleted.
      # Created to integrate with notifiarr.com.
      # Also works natively with Discord.com, Telegram.org, and Slack.com webhooks.
      # Can possibly be used with other services by providing a custom template_path.
      ###### Don't forget to uncomment [[webhook]] and url at a minimum !!!!
    docs: |
      This application can send a `POST` webhook to a URL when an extraction begins, and again
      when it finishes. Configure 1 or more webhook URLs with the parameters below.
      Works great with [notifiarr.com](https://notifiarr.com). You can use
      [requestbin.com](https://requestbin.com/r/) to test and _see_ the payload.
    notes: |
      - _`Nickname` should equal the `chat_id` value in Telegram webhooks._
      - _`Channel` is used as destination channel for Slack. It's not used in others._
      - _`Nickname` and `Channel` may be used as custom values in custom templates._
      - _`Name` is only used in logs, but it's also available as a template value as `{{name}}`._
      - Built-In Templates: `pushover`, `telegram`, `discord`, `notifiarr`, `slack`, `gotify`.

  cmdhook:
    title: Command Hooks
    docs: |
      Unpackerr can execute commands (or scripts) before and after an archive extraction.
      The only thing required is a command. Name is optional, and used in logs only.
      Setting `shell` to `true` executes your command after `/bin/sh -c` or `cmd.exe /c`
      on Windows.
    tail: |
      All extraction data is input to the command using environment variables, see example below.
      Extracted files variables names begin with `UN_DATA_FILES_`.
      Try `/usr/bin/env` as an example command to see what variables are available.
