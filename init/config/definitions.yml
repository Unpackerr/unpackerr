    docs: |
      These values must exist at the top of the config file.
      If you put them anywhere else they may be attached to a `[header]` inadvertently.
      When using environment variables, you can simply omit the ones you don't set or change from default.
    params:
      - name: debug
        envvar: DEBUG
        default: false
        recommend: *BOOLEAN
        short: Turns on more logs.
        desc: |
          Turn on debug messages in the output. Do not wrap this in quotes.
          Recommend trying this so you know what it looks like. I personally leave it on.
      - name: quiet
        envvar: QUIET
        default: false
        recommend: *BOOLEAN
        short: Do not print logs to stdout or stderr.
        desc: |
          Disable writing messages to stdout/stderr. This silences the app. Set a log
          file below if you set this to true. Recommended when starting with systemctl.
      - name: error_stderr
        envvar: ERROR_STDERR
        default: false
        recommend: *BOOLEAN
        short: Print ERROR lines to stderr instead of stdout.
        desc: |
          Send error output to stderr instead of stdout by setting error_stderr to true.
          Recommend leaving this at false. Ignored if quiet (above) is true.
      - name: activity
        envvar: ACTIVITY
        default: false
        recommend: *BOOLEAN
        short: Setting true will print only queue counts with activity.
        desc: |
          Setting activity to true will silence all app queue log lines with only zeros.
          Set this to true when you want less log spam.
      - name: log_queues
        envvar: LOG_QUEUES
        default: '1m'
        short: How often to print internal counters. Uses Go Duration.
        recommend: *QUEUE_INTERVALS
        desc: |
          The Starr-application activity queue is logged on an interval.
          Adjust that interval with this setting.
          Default is a minute. 2m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h are also perfectly acceptable.
      - name: log_file
        envvar: LOG_FILE
        default: ''
        example: /downloads/unpackerr.log
        short: Provide optional file path to write logs
        desc: |
          Write messages to a log file. This is the same data that is normally output to stdout.
          This setting is great for Docker users that want to export their logs to a file.
          The alternative is to use syslog to log the output of the application to a file.
          Default is no log file; this is unset.
          Except on macOS and Windows, the log file gets set to "~/.unpackerr/unpackerr.log"
          log_files=0 turns off auto-rotation.
          Default files is 10 and size(mb) is 10 Megabytes.
      - name: log_files
        envvar: LOG_FILES
        default: 10
        recommend: &NUMBERS

          - value: 10
          - value: 15
          - value: 20
        short: Log files to keep after rotating. `0` disables rotation
      - name: log_file_mb
        envvar: LOG_FILE_MB
        default: 10
        recommend: *NUMBERS
        short: Max size of log files in megabytes
      - name: log_file_mode
        envvar: LOG_FILE_MODE
        default: '0600'
        recommend: &FILE_MODES

          - value: '0640'
          - value: '0660'
          - value: '0644'
          - value: '0664'
        short: 'POSIX mode used for new log files; not for Windows'
      - name: interval
        envvar: INTERVAL
        default: 2m
        recommend: *GLOBAL_INTERVALS
        short: How often apps are polled, recommend `1m` to `5m`.
        desc: |
          How often to poll starr apps (sonarr, radarr, etc).
          Recommend 1m-5m. Uses Go Duration.
      - name: progress
        envvar: PROGRESS
        default: 15s
        recommend:
          - name: '2 seconds'
            value: '2s'
          - name: '5 seconds'
            value: '5s'

          - name: '1 minute'
            value: '1m'
        short: How often status is logged for in-progress extractions.
        desc: |
          How often status is logged for in-progress extractions.
          Recommend 2-60s. Uses Go Duration.
      - name: start_delay
        envvar: START_DELAY
        default: 1m
        recommend: *GLOBAL_INTERVALS
        short: Files are queued at least this long before extraction.
        desc: |
          How long an item must be queued (download complete) before extraction will start.
          One minute is the historic default and works well. Set higher if your downloads
          take longer to finalize (or transfer locally). Uses Go Duration.
      - name: retry_delay
        envvar: RETRY_DELAY
        default: 5m
        recommend: *GLOBAL_INTERVALS
        short: Failed extractions are retried after at least this long.
        desc: |
          How long to wait before removing the history for a failed extraction.
          Once the history is deleted the item will be recognized as new and
          extraction will start again. Uses Go Duration.
      - name: max_retries
        envvar: MAX_RETRIES
        default: 3
        recommend: *NUMBERS
        short: Failed extractions are retried after at least this long.
        desc: |
          How many times to retry a failed extraction. Pauses retry_delay between attempts.
      - name: parallel
        envvar: PARALLEL
        default: 1
        recommend: *NUMBERS
        short: Concurrent extractions, only recommend `1`
        desc: |
          How many files may be extracted in parallel. 1 works fine.
          Do not wrap the number in quotes. Raise this only if you have fast disks and CPU.
      - name: file_mode
        envvar: FILE_MODE
        default: '0644'
        recommend: *FILE_MODES
        short: Extracted files are written with this mode.
        desc: |
          Use these configurations to control the file modes used for newly extracted
          files and folders. Recommend 0644/0755 or 0666/0777.
      - name: dir_mode
        envvar: DIR_MODE
        default: '0755'
        recommend:

          - value: '0770'
          - value: '0775'
        short: Extracted folders are written with this mode
      - name: passwords
        envvar: PASSWORD_
        default: []
        kind: list
        short: List of passwords to use for encrypted archives.
        desc: |

  webserver:
    title: Web Server
    docs: |
      :::note Metrics
      The web server currently only provides prometheus metrics, which you can display in
      [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18817-unpackerr/).
      It provides no UI. This may change in the future. The web server was added in v0.12.0.

      - name: listen_addr
        envvar: LISTEN_ADDR
        default: 0.0.0.0:5656
        short: ip:port to listen on; `0.0.0.0` is all IPs.

      - name: log_file
        envvar: LOG_FILE
        default: ''

        short: List of upstream proxy CIDRs or IPs to trust.
        desc: |
          Upstreams should be set to the IP or CIDR of your trusted upstream proxy.
          Setting this correctly allows X-Forwarded-For to be used in logs.
          In the future it may control auth proxy trust. Must be a list of strings.
          example: upstreams = [ "127.0.0.1/32", "10.1.2.0/24" ]

      ################
      # Sends a webhook when an extraction queues, starts, finishes, and/or is deleted.
      # Created to integrate with notifiarr.com.
      # Also works natively with Discord.com, Telegram.org, and Slack.com webhooks.
      # Can possibly be used with other services by providing a custom template_path.
      ###### Don't forget to uncomment [[webhook]] and url at a minimum !!!!
    docs: |
      This application can send a `POST` webhook to a URL when an extraction begins, and again
      when it finishes. Configure 1 or more webhook URLs with the parameters below.
      Works great with [notifiarr.com](https://notifiarr.com). You can use
      [requestbin.com](https://requestbin.com/r/) to test and _see_ the payload.
    notes: |
      - _`Nickname` should equal the `chat_id` value in Telegram webhooks._

  cmdhook:
    title: Command Hooks
    docs: |
      Unpackerr can execute commands (or scripts) before and after an archive extraction.
      The only thing required is a command. Name is optional, and used in logs only.
      Setting `shell` to `true` executes your command after `/bin/sh -c` or `cmd.exe /c`
      on Windows.
    tail: |
      All extraction data is input to the command using environment variables, see example below.
      Extracted files variables names begin with `UN_DATA_FILES_`.
      Try `/usr/bin/env` as an example command to see what variables are available.
