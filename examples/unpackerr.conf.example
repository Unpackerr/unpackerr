##      Unpackerr Example Configuration File      ##
## The following values are application defaults. ##

####################################################

# [true/false] Turn on debug messages in the output. Do not wrap this in quotes.
# Recommend trying this so you know what it looks like. I personally leave it on.
debug = false

# Disable writing messages to stdout. This silences the app. You should set a log
# file below if you set this to true.
quiet = false

# Write messages to a log file. This is the same data that is normally output to stdout.
# This setting is great for Docker users that want to export their logs to a file.
# The alternative is to use syslog to log the output of the application to a file.
# Default is no log file; this is unset. log_files=0 turns off auto-rotation.
# Default files is 10 and size(mb) is 10 Megabytes; both doubled if debug is true.
# Windows paths must use two backslashes: "C:\\Some\\Path\\Unpacker.log" (true everywhere).
#log_file = "/downloads/unpackerr.log"

# How often to poll sonarr and radarr.
# Recommend 1m-5m. Uses Go Duration.
interval = "2m"

# How long an item must be queued (download complete) before extraction will start.
# One minute is the historic default and works well. Set higher if your downloads
# take longer to finalize (or transfer locally). Uses Go Duration.
start_delay = "1m"

# How long to wait before removing the history for a failed extraction.
# Once the history is deleted the item will be recognized as new and
# extraction will start again. Uses Go Duration.
retry_delay = "5m"

# How many files may be extracted in parallel. 1 works fine.
# Do not wrap the number in quotes. Raise this only if you have fast disks and CPU.
parallel = 1

# Use these configurations to control the file modes used for newly extracted
# files and folders. Recommend 0644/0755 or 0666/0777.

## The following sections can be repeated if you have more than one Sonarr,   ##
## Radarr or Lidarr, Readarr, Folder or Webhook.                              ##
## You must uncomment the [[header]] and api_key at a minimum for Starr apps. ##

################
### Webhooks ###
################
# Sends a webhook when an extraction queues, starts, finishes, and is deleted.
# Created to integrate with notifiarr.com.
# Also works natively with Discord.com, Telegram.org, and Slack.com webhooks.
# Can possibly be used with other services by providing a custom template_path.
###### Don't forget to uncomment [[webhook]] and url at a minimum !!!!
#[[webhook]]
#  url    = "https://discordnotifier.com/notifier.php?api=abcdef-ghijklmn-op"
#  name   = ""    # Set this to hide the URL in logs.
#  silent = false # do not log success (less log spam)
#  events = [0]   # list of event ids to include, 0 == all.
## Advanced Optional Webhook Configuration
#  nickname      = ""    # Used in Discord and Slack templates as bot name, in Telegram as chat_id.
#  channel       = ""    # Also passed into templates. Used in Slack templates for destination channel.
#  exclude       = []    # list of apps to exclude, ie. ["radarr", "lidarr"]
#  template_path = ""    # Override internal webhook template for discord.com or other hooks.
#  ignore_ssl    = false # Set this to true to ignore the SSL certificate on the server.
#  timeout       = "10s" # You can adjust how long to wait for a server response.
#  content_type  = "application/json" # If your custom template uses another MIME type, set this.
