# [true/false] Turn on debug messages in the output. Do not wrap this in quotes.
# Recommend trying this so you know what it looks like. I personally leave it on.
debug = false

# Disable writing messages to stdout. This silences the app. You should set a log
# file below if you set this to true. Recommended when starting with systemctl.
quiet = false

# Setting activity to true will silence all app queue log lines with only zeros.
# Set this to true when you want less log spam.
activity = false

# The application queue data is logged on an interval. Adjust that interval with this setting.
# Default is a minute. 2m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h are also perfectly acceptable.
log_queues = "1m"

# Write messages to a log file. This is the same data that is normally output to stdout.
# This setting is great for Docker users that want to export their logs to a file.
# The alternative is to use syslog to log the output of the application to a file.
# Default is no log file; this is unset. log_files=0 turns off auto-rotation.
# Default files is 10 and size(mb) is 10 Megabytes; both doubled if debug is true.
#log_file = '/downloads/unpackerr.log'
log_files = 10

# How often to poll sonarr and radarr.
# Recommend 1m-5m. Uses Go Duration.
interval = "2m"

# How long an item must be queued (download complete) before extraction will start.
# One minute is the historic default and works well. Set higher if your downloads
# take longer to finalize (or transfer locally). Uses Go Duration.
start_delay = "1m"

# How long to wait before removing the history for a failed extraction.
# Once the history is deleted the item will be recognized as new and
# extraction will start again. Uses Go Duration.
retry_delay = "5m"

# How many files may be extracted in parallel. 1 works fine.
# Do not wrap the number in quotes. Raise this only if you have fast disks and CPU.
parallel = 1

# Use these configurations to control the file modes used for newly extracted
# files and folders. Recommend 0644/0755 or 0666/0777.

[webserver]
## The web server currently only supports metrics; set this to true if you wish to use it.

## This may be set to a port or an ip:port to bind a specific IP. 0.0.0.0 binds ALL IPs.
  listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:5656"
## Recommend setting a log file for HTTP requests. Otherwise, they go with other logs.
  log_file = ""
## This app automatically rotates logs. Set these to the size and number to keep.
  log_files = 10
  log_file_mb = 10
## Set both of these to valid file paths to enable HTTPS/TLS.
  ssl_cert_file = ""
  ssl_key_file = ""
## Base URL from which to serve content.
  urlbase = "/"
## Upstreams should be set to the IP or CIDR of your trusted upstream proxy.
## Setting this correctly allows X-Forwarded-For to be used in logs.
## In the future it may control auth proxy trust. Must be a list of strings.
  upstreams = [ ] # example: upstreams = [ "127.0.0.1/32", "10.1.2.0/24" ]
