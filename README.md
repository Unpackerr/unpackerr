## About

This application runs as a daemon on your download host. It checks for completed
downloads and extracts them so Radarr and/or Sonarr and/or Lidarr may import them.

There are a handful of options out there for extracting and deleting files after
your client downloads them. I just didn't care for any of them, so I wrote my own. I
wanted a small single-binary with reasonable logging that can extract downloaded
archives and clean up the mess after they've been imported.

## Installation

-   **Note**: Requires access to your download location.
    Make sure you set the `path` variables correctly in the configuration.

### Docker

This project builds automatically in [Docker Cloud](https://hub.docker.com/r/golift/unpackerr)
and creates [ready-to-use multi-architecture images](https://hub.docker.com/r/golift/unpackerr/tags).
The `latest` tag is always a tagged release in GitHub. The `master` tag corresponds
to the `master` branch in GitHub and may be broken.

Use the methods below to install using Docker.

#### unRAID (Docker)

-   Unpackerr is available in the
    [Community Applications](https://github.com/selfhosters/unRAID-CA-templates/blob/master/templates/unpackerr.xml)
    on unRAID.

#### Docker Config File

-   Copy the [example config file](examples/unpackerr.conf.example) from this repo.
-   Then grab the image from docker hub and run it using an overlay for the config file.

```shell
docker pull golift/unpackerr
docker run -d -v /mnt/HostDownloads:/downloads -v /your/config/unpackerr.conf:/etc/unpackerr/unpackerr.conf golift/unpackerr
docker logs <container id from docker run>
```


#### Docker Env Variables

-   Instead of a config file, you may configure the docker container
    with environment variables.
-   Any variable not provided takes the default.
-   Must provide URL and API key for Sonarr or Radarr or Lidarr or any combination.
-   You may provide multiple sonarr, radarr or lidarr instances using
    `UN_SONARR_1_URL`, `UN_SONARR_2_URL`, etc.

|Config Name|Variable Name|Default / Note|

readarr.protocols|`UN_READARR_0_PROTOCOLS`|`torrent` Protocols to process. Alt: `torrent,usenet`|

##### Folder

Folders are a way to watch a folder for things to extract. You can use this to
monitor your download client's "move to" path if you're not using it with an *arr app.

|Config Name|Variable Name|Default / Note|
|---|---|---|
folder.path|`UN_FOLDER_0_PATH`|No Default. Folder to watch for archives. Not for *arr apps.|

folder.move_back|`UN_FOLDER_0_MOVE_BACK`|`false` Move extracted items back into original folder.|

##### Webhooks

This application can send a POST webhook to a URL when an extraction begins, and again
when it finishes. Configure 1 or more webhook URLs with the parameters below.
Works great with [discordnotifier.com](https://discordnotifier.com). You can use
[requestbin.com](https://requestbin.com/r/) to test and _see_ the payload.

|Config Name|Variable Name|Default / Note|
|---|---|---|
webhook.url|`UN_WEBHOOK_0_URL`|No Default. URL to send POST webhook to.|
webhook.name|`UN_WEBHOOK_0_NAME`|Defaults to URL. Provide an optional name to hide the URL in logs.|
webhook.timeout|`UN_WEBHOOK_0_TIMEOUT`|Defaults to global timeout, usually `10s`.|
webhook.silent|`UN_WEBHOOK_0_SILENT`|`false` / Hide successful POSTs from logs.|
webhook.ignore_ssl|`UN_WEBHOOK_0_IGNORE_SSL`|`false` / Ignore invalid SSL certificates.|
webhook.exclude|`UN_WEBHOOK_0_EXCLUDE`|`[]` / List of apps to exclude: radarr, sonarr, folders, etc.|
webhook.events|`UN_WEBHOOK_0_EVENTS`|`[0]` / List of event IDs to send (shown below).|

Event IDs (not all of these are used in webhooks): `0` = all,
`1` = queued, `2` = extracting, `3` = extract failed, `4` = extracted,
`5` = imported, `6` = deleting, `7` = delete failed, `8` = deleted

##### Example Usage

```shell
docker pull golift/unpackerr
docker run -d -v /mnt/HostDownloads:/downloads -e "UN_SONARR_0_URL=http://localhost:8989" -e "UN_SONARR_0_API_KEY=kjsdkasjdaksdj" golift/unpackerr
docker logs <container id from docker run>
```

#### More Dockers!

 If you want a container that has a bit more to it, you can try a third party option.
 The container provided by golift is from scratch so it has nothing more than a binary
 and a config file (with our defaults).

-   **[@madcatsu](https://github.com/madcatsu) maintains an
    [Alpine Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/madcatsu/unpackerr-alpine-daemon)
    for Unpackerr.** ([repo](https://gitlab.com/madcatsu/docker-unpackerr-alpine-daemon))

-   **[@hotio](https://github.com/hotio) maintains a
    [Custom Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/hotio/unpackerr)
    for Unpackerr.** ([repo](https://github.com/hotio/docker-unpackerr))

### Linux and FreeBSD Install

-   Download a package from the [Releases](https://github.com/davidnewhall/unpackerr/releases) page.
-   Install it, edit config, start it.

Example of the above in shell form:

```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidnewhall/unpackerr/master/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash

nano /etc/unpackerr/unpackerr.conf         # linux
vi /usr/local/etc/unpackerr/unpackerr.conf # freebsd

sudo systemctl restart unpackerr    # linux
service unpackerr start             # freebsd
```

### macOS Install

-   Use homebrew.
-   Edit config file at `/usr/local/etc/unpackerr/unpackerr.conf`
-   Start it.
-   Like this:

```shell
brew install golift/mugs/unpackerr
vi /usr/local/etc/unpackerr/unpackerr.conf
brew services start unpackerr
```

## Troubleshooting

Make sure your Downloads location matches on all your applications!

Log files:

-   Linux: `/var/log/messages` or `/var/log/syslog` (w/ default syslog)
-   FreeBSD: `/var/log/syslog` (w/ default syslog)
-   macOS: `/usr/local/var/log/unpackerr.log`

If transfers are in a Warning or Error state they will not be extracted.
Try the Force Recheck option if you use Deluge.

## Logic

The application polls radarr, sonarr and lidarr at the interval configured. The
queued items are inspected for completeness. The interval of these pollers is set
in the config file. 1-10 minutes is generally sufficient.

When Unpackerr finds an item in Sonarr or Radarr or Lidarr the download location
is checked for a `.rar` file. If an extractable archive exists, and **Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr
has `status=Completed` from your download client** Unpackerr will extract the file.
Files are extracted to a temporary folder, and then moved back into the download
location for Completed Download Handling to import them. When the item falls out of the
(Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr) queue, the extracted files are deleted.
